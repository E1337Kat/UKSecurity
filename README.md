### UK Security

This program can be used to encrypt data in a way that conforms with the UK's new stands on having unbreakable encryption.

This encryption is totally unbreakable, unless you have a warrant, then you can break it, which means terrorists and pedophiles cannot use it to secure their comms.

It totally has no backdoors in it AT ALL.

#### Requirements:
None!

#### How to use:
